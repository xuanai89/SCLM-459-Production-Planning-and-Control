# Production Planning & Control Analysis for AMC (SCLM 459)

## Project Overview

This project applies core concepts of production planning and control to the Advanced Manufacturing Center (AMC) at EIU. The analysis is divided into two main parts: understanding the production environment and forecasting future demand based on historical sales data.

The goal is to provide insights into AMC's current operations and offer data-driven recommendations for improvement.

## Key Areas Covered

The analysis includes:

1.  **Analysis of the Production Environment:**

**Production Layout:** Description of AMC's **Functional (Process) Layout**, its benefits (versatility, resource allocation, specialization), and limitations (complex material handling, potential inefficiency, skill requirements).

**Production Model Classification:** Identification and justification of AMC using **Make-to-Order (MTO)** and **Engineer-to-Order (ETO)** models, while explaining why MTS and ATO are not used.

**Production Type Determination:** Classification as **Job Production** (due to individual, smaller-scale orders) and **Project Production** (managing custom designs as projects).

**Demand & Inventory Management:** Description of AMC's reliance on received orders rather than specific forecasting methods, likely application of **Just-In-Time (JIT)** principles for materials, and cooperation with partners/ASPIRE for orders.

2.  **Demand Forecasting:**

**Data Description:** Analysis based on monthly sales revenue data for 2023 and 2024.

**Data Analysis:** Examination of significant revenue growth (424% from 2023 to 2024), revenue trends (shift from latter-half concentration in 2023 to more consistency in 2024), seasonality (peaks in mid-to-late year, especially June and December), demand variability, and influencing factors (customer base, project volume, industrial cycles).

**Forecasting Methods Evaluated:**

3-Month Moving Average

Weighted Moving Average

Exponential Smoothing

**Forecasting Results & Selection:** Comparison of Mean Forecast Error (MFE) and Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for each method. 

**Exponential Smoothing** is recommended as the most optimal due to its lowest MAD, indicating greater stability.

3.  **Forecasting Report & Recommendations:**

Summary of AMC's overview and production goals.

Recap of the production environment analysis.

Overview of the forecasting process and results.

**Recommendations:** Continue using Exponential Smoothing, align production schedules with seasonal peaks, implement JIT formally, expand customer base, invest in automation, and regularly review/update forecasting models.
